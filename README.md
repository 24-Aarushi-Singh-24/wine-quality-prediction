# Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression

This repository contains the code and resources for my wine quality prediction project using linear regression. The aim of the project was to develop a model that could accurately predict the quality of wines based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is called "winequality-red.csv". It contains information about various properties of red wines and their associated quality ratings. The dataset includes the following features:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Change into the project directory.
3. Ensure you have installed the required dependencies as mentioned in the requirements.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform wine quality prediction using linear regression.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the model, we perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This step includes visualizations and data summary statistics to understand the distribution and relationships between features and the target variable.

## Data Preprocessing

In this step, we preprocess the data by handling any missing values, scaling the features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Linear Regression Model

We build a linear regression model using scikit-learn to predict the wine quality based on the selected features.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the model, we calculate Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) scores.

## Results

We present the model's predictions and compare them to the actual wine quality ratings in the dataset.

## Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Install the required dependencies.
- Run the wine_quality_prediction.ipynb notebook to execute the project code.
- Explore the results and evaluate the model's performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different features, and enhance the project further. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
